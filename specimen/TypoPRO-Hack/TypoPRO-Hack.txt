No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced
to be a workhorse face for code. It has deep roots in the libre, open
source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the
Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The face has been re-designed with a
larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph shapes (including
distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the regular
set to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous
attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to improve
the rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small text sizes).
The large x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design combined with
Type 1 hinting/hint replacement programs and a TrueType instruction set
make it highly legible at commonly used source code text sizes with
a sweet spot that runs in the 8px - 12px range on modern desktop and
laptop monitors. Combine it with an HD monitor and you can comfortably
work at 6 or 7px sizes.

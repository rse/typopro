Derivation: Grotesques

Work Sans is a typeface based loosely on early Grotesques — i.e.
Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei. There are
10 weights (the 10th Hairline weight is considered a bonus since CSS
only allows for 9 weight families). The core of the fonts are optimised
for on-screen medium-sized text usage (14px-48px) – but still can be
used in print well. The fonts extreme weights are designed more for
display use. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen
resolutions – for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they
would be in print.

Preamble
----------

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
